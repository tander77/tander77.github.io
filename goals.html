            <p>Ever since I was a child, my dream has been to help in creating technologies that have been confined to the realm of science fiction.</p>
            <p>To this end, I have studied Engineering at the University of Toronto. Soon after starting my program, I realized that my dream would take a combination of engineering and entrepreneurship.</p>
            <p>As such, I enrolled in the Engineering Business Minor to gain the knowledge in this field that I would need.</p>
            <p>It is my goal to one day become an entrepreneur in the fields of robotics and artificial intelligence and create new devices that both help people and make life more fun.</p>
